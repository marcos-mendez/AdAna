## Future Improvements

- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Introduce more comprehensive data analysis and visualization features to help companies better understand their ad performance.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Implement real-time tracking of ad campaigns to provide instant feedback on ad performance.
